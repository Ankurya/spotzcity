  <p>SpotzCity realizes that starting a business is one of the most challenging and courageous things one can do. We celebrate the path of entrepreneurship and all of the successes that it can bring.</p>
  <p>SpotzCity expresses the spirit of entrepreneurship by creating categories for small business owners to define and observe their enterprise. Categories like Dadpreneurs, Disabledpreneurs, Entrepreneurs, Kidpreneurs(under 18), Millennialpreneurs, Mompreneurs, Seniorpreneurs (over 65), Vetpreneurs, Arabpreneurs, Asianpreneurs, Blackpreneuers, Caucasianpreneurs, Jewishpreneurs, Latinopreneurs, LGBTQpreneurs, Nativepreneurs, Womanpreneurs, and Otherpreneurs, are all representative of an American society that is multicultural and inclusive. The SpotzCity website will allow these classifications to be searchable options so that customers can find small businesses which fit the types of businesses they would like to support. As part of our growth we will add new ethnicities and categories when we observe that there is an influx of participation in those areas.</p>

  <p>SpotzCity is a place where entrepreneurs can register and claim their businesses and use the marketplace as a web presence to connect with current and future customers. SpotzCity allows entrepreneurs to upload banners and photos of their businesses and products to market and spotlight their companies. Providing inspiration, education, ideas, resources, and access to potential customers is a significant aspect of what we also do.</p>
  <p>SpotzCity supplies information from the start to the sale of a business and everything in between.
