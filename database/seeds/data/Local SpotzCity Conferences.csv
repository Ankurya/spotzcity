State Fair,Missouri State Fair 2020,Sedalia,Missouri,"3,50,000",-,Aug 13 - Aug 23,"Visit the Fair's website, www.mostatefair.com, for the most up-to-date, comprehensive information about the 2020 event. Since the first Fair in 1901, thousands of Missouri families have made the annual ?pilgrimage? to Sedalia. Despite numerous differences, the Fair exhibitors of 1901 and today share an important common element. That common denominator is competition - the desire to put your efforts against your neighbor?s best.

Since the first State Fair, the reward has been ribbons, premium money and recognition. But the long-term effect of this healthy competition has been a steady improvement in Missouri?s agriculture, agribusiness, domestic arts and, today, even fine arts.

From 1901 to today, the Missouri State Fair has been a barometer of the state?s economic health and a documentary of the history of Missouri agriculture. The Missouri State Fair plays an essential role in keeping agriculture one of Missouri?s top industries.

Prepare to be entertained by the best show-offs in the state from livestock to competitive exhibitors and the amazing free professional entertainment package. The 2020 Missouri State Fair will be the premier summer event of the year that you don't want to miss!

The Missouri State Fair is among the state's oldest and most tradition-rich events for summer family fun. 2020 marks the 118th Missouri State Fair, and we welcome all Missourians to join us for an exciting season."

With Chicago's Skyline as a backdrop, audience numbers reach 2 million annually making the Chicago Air & Water Show the largest FREE admission air and water exhibition of its kind in the United States. Over the years the show has featured some of the top civilian and military pilots and aircraft. Biennially, the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds headline along with the U.S. Army Parachute Team Golden Knights and the U.S. Navy Leap Frogs.

The Chicago Air & Water Show is conducted in an extremely safe and conscientious way. Safety precautions are taken at all times before, during and after the show. Planes take off and land at the Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary, Indiana. All pilots perform stunts over the water in a set safety area. When a plane does fly over buildings, it is merely doing so in its flight path to return to the show area or the airport."

Colorado became a state in 1876 and before the Colorado flag flew high, the State Fair was already earning its place in history.

In 1869, approximately 2,000 people converged on what is now Pueblo for a horse exhibition; and from that meager beginning was born the Colorado State Fair.

The Fair continues to call Pueblo home, and in fact, has only cancelled once during its entire history. In 1917, during World War I, the Fairgrounds' horse stables and open space offered an ideal training facility for the Army National Guard.

Since then, the Colorado State Fair has developed into the largest summer event in the State and offers families a fun, educational summer vacation!"

Every year since then, every third full weekend in September sees the same caliber of talent grace the now eight stages on the Monterey Fairgrounds, as the Monterey Jazz Festival presents the best jazz performers in the world for a three-day celebration of the best in jazz. In addition, the Monterey Jazz Festival features jazz conversations, panel discussions, workshops, exhibitions, clinics, and an international array of food, shopping, and festivities spread throughout the 20-acre Monterey County Fairgrounds.

Monterey Jazz Festival is a 501(c)3 educational nonprofit corporation.

From its modest beginnings in 1972 with 13 balloons launching from a shopping mall parking lot, the Balloon Fiesta has grown to multiple events launching year-round at the custom-designed, 365-acre Balloon Fiesta Park. Our signature event remains Balloon Fiesta?which, with almost 600 balloons, is the largest ballooning event on earth, the most photographed event on earth, and the largest annual international event held in the United States.

Imagine 54 football fields, all put together. That's the size of Balloon Fiesta Park's 78-acre launch field! And at this Park's ""playing field,"" there are no losing teams and no viewing stands. Guests walk the field and are part of the action.

Hundreds of thousands of smiling, upturned faces, awestruck by the spectacular beauty of hot air balloons filling the big blue New Mexico sky. What you can't hear until you walk our field at nightfall is the thrilling roar of hundreds of burners simultaneously igniting, turning the Park into a huge lighted Christmas tree of colorful balloons. What you can't feel until you join us is the massive joy everywhere around you."

Animal & Pets,National Peanut Festival 2020,Dothan,Alabama,-,-,Nov 6 - Nov 15,"Event Overview: The National Peanut Festival, the nation's largest peanut festival, is held in Dothan, Alabama each fall to honor local peanut farmers and to celebrate the harvest season.

Located in the southeast corner of Alabama, Dothan is known as the ""Peanut Capital of the World"" and is a prime location for growing peanuts.  In fact, if you're in Dothan you're in the heart of peanut country, considering the majority of all the peanuts grown in the United States are grown within a 100 mile radius of Dothan.

A festival honoring the peanut was inaugurated on a near freezing Thursday, November 10, 1938.  The three day event included a pageant, parade, historical play and grand ball.  The guest speaker was Dr. George Washington Carver.  Dr. Carver was a modest, unassuming man from the Tuskegee Institute who gained international fame with his development of over 300 products from the peanut.

The peanut festival was celebrated annually through 1941, but was postponed until after World War II.  In 1947, the first post-war festival was presented and has continued every year since.

Throughout its history, the festival has been held in various locations, with most of its years at the Houston County Farm Center.  The National Peanut Festival has been at its current location, the fairgrounds on US Highway 231 South, since 1999.  With over 200 acres, 2 exhibit buildings, an amphitheater, an open air arena and an Ag complex, the fairgrounds are now capable of hosting year-round events and further promoting agriculture in the Wiregrass area, in addition to hosting the yearly harvest celebration.

Today, the National Peanut Festival has grown from a three-day event in 1938, to a ten-day event with attendance in excess of 150,000 fairgoers.  Throughout those 10 days, the festival hosts numerous fun-filled, family events...amusement rides, animal attractions, agricultural displays, concerts, livestock shows and a parade.  Of course we wouldn't be the National Peanut Festival without tons of PEANUTS!

This enormous event would not be possible every year without the more than 300 volunteers who give countless hours throughout the year in order to continue the festival's success.  The local peanut farmers and the entire Wiregrass agriculture industry are to be commended for their continued dedication in giving this area a reason for celebrating such an important economic product.
